Pypianoroll
===========

A modified version of Pypianoroll, based on original 1.0.2 version. Support NumPy format JSON Dump/Read.


Pypianoroll is an open source Python library for working with piano rolls. It provides essential tools for handling multitrack piano rolls, including efficient I/O as well as manipulation, visualization and evaluation tools.


Features
--------

- Manipulate multitrack piano rolls intuitively
- Visualize multitrack piano rolls beautifully
- Save and load multitrack piano rolls in a space-efficient format
- Parse MIDI files into multitrack piano rolls
- Write multitrack piano rolls into MIDI files


Why Pypianoroll
---------------

Our aim is to provide convenient classes for piano-roll matrix and MIDI-like track information (program number, track name, drum track indicator). Pypianoroll is also designed to provide efficient I/O for piano rolls, since piano rolls have long been considered an inefficient way to store music data due to the sparse nature.


Installation
------------

To install Pypianoroll, please run `pip install pypianoroll`. To build Pypianoroll from source, please download the [source](https://github.com/salu133445/pypianoroll/releases) and run `python setup.py install`.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available [here](https://salu133445.github.io/pypianoroll) and as docstrings with the code.

Lakh Pianoroll Dataset
----------------------

[Lakh Pianoroll Dataset](https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/dataset) (LPD) is a new multitrack piano roll dataset using Pypianoroll for efficient data I/O and to save space, which is used as the training dataset in our [MuseGAN](https://salu133445.github.io/musegan) project.
